Efficiencies
	-input based running time
		-EX. A sequential search
			+Worst Case: item is in the last item checked
			+Best Case: item is the first item checked
			+Average Case: avg is not the mid point between best and worst
							Use probability to determine the likelyhood a box will be picked
							
	-Notation
		big O notation(O)
		big omega notaion
		big theta notation
		t(n) = time function
		g(n) = general fucntion to compare against
			
			O(g(n)) = set of all func. with a lower or same order of growth as g(n)
			Omega(g(n)) = opposite of O(g(n))
			Theta(g(n)) = set of all func. with the same order of growth as g(n)
			
	you can take the limit as n -> infinity of one f()/g() to determine which func. is smaller
	
	string suggest looking over the slides. They explain things rather well
