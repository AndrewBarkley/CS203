how to analyzize

	-decide on parameters

	-identify the basic opertion

	-check the number of times executed.

	-setup reccurence relation

	-

empircal algorithms of analysis
	
	1) understand the purpuse of the algorythm
	
	2) Decide in the efficiency metric M to be measured, and the measurement unit (an operation count vs. time unit
	
	3) Decide on the characteristics of the input sample (it's range, size, etc.)
	
	4) prepare a program implementation of teh algorithm
	
	5) generate a sample of inputs
	
	6) run the algorithm on the sample of inputs and record the data
	
	7) analize the data
